This project is a Sudoku Solver developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, designed to solve standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It takes a partially filled Sudoku grid as input and fills in the missing numbers while ensuring that all Sudoku rules are followed. The code demonstrates key programming concepts such as recursion, conditionals, loops, and grid-based data structures, making it an excellent learning tool for understanding algorithmic problem solving. The Jupyter Notebook format offers clear code explanations alongside execution, making it easy for users to follow the logic and test different puzzles. This project is not a standalone application but an educational and functional script that can be run in any Python-supported environment. To use it, simply open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook, input a Sudoku puzzle, and run the cells to see the solution.
